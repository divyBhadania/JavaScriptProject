    title1 : "Brief introduction of Amul",
    subtext1 : "AMUL stands for Anand Milk Utpadak Ltd. It is based out of Anand, Gujarat, and is the largest dairy producer in India and the eighth largest in the world. It compromises around 17 cooperative bodies. It basically collects milk from farmers and sells it under its brand. It also shares the profits with associated farmers. So, unlike other private companies, lakhs of farmers are the real stakeholders of the company. This implies that it is not a private company but a cooperative society.",
    title2 : "What is a cooperative society?",
    subtext2 : "A cooperative society is a group of common people who work together with the intent to grow. They work on the principle of self-help. Their primary goal is to support each other and everyone makes a profit. Respective State’s Society Act governs them."

    title1 : "The reason for purchase:",
    subtext1 : "Right, so let me begin with why I chose the Ather. Rewind back to 2021, we decided to transition to EVs because of rising fuel and maintenance costs. We decided to replace our two cars, a 2013 Verna and a 2017 Kwid. Long story short, we replaced the former with an MG ZS and were looking for a replacement for the Kwid. If you'd like to read more about the MG's buying and ownership experience.",
    title2 : "The contenders:",
    subtext2 : "Anyway, coming back to the Ather. Considering that I was the primary user of the Kwid and didn't particularly require a car, I wanted a two-wheeler that was cheap to run and maintain and have a decent amount of useful features. My commute was around 20 -30 kms every other day, and it would rarely exceed 40 - 50 kms. Hence, an EV was definitely in the books. I didn't consider the cheaper offerings because they seemed primarily targeted at the e-commerce segment and didn't really appeal to me."

    title1 : "Big Pharma",
    subtext1 : "These companies have been around for a while, and are financially stable, holding patented medications they’ve developed or purchased. These stocks are considered to be a good defensive strategy; a great example would be S&P 500 Health Care - in the last year, it has outperformed the S&P 500, going up more than 9% versus -0.5% respectively.",
    title2 : "Biotech",
    subtext2 : "The biotechnology companies develop treatments and cures for various diseases and syndromes. It’s not uncommon for these company to be bought by, and integrated into larger pharmaceutical organizations. Their stocks are more volatile, and can dramatically change with each success and failure of clinical trials and news of impending takeovers."

To facilitate transactions, Facebook also created a new subsidiary called Calibra that will offer digital wallets for the Libra.",
    title2 : "Will People Even Use Libra Coin?",
    subtext2 : "Facebook has a really bad reputation for a lot of reasons. Will people really trust them with their finances and hand over control of their money to Mark Zuckerberg, especially in light of revelations last year that U.K.-based Cambridge Analytica improperly accessed 87 million Facebook users’ data."
